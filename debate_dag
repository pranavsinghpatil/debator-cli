And as we‏re all aware, at times a scientist does not know what is truly required for it, and in short, it is wrong to assume a science as valuable as medicine. As a scientist, I don't need to be the only one to know all the basics of how biology works. I do" shape=note]
		Arg_2 [label="R2: , there are a hundred, if not hundreds of millions, of human beings, who have been trained as philosophers' intellectual forebears and have taken very seriously that it is 'necessary to ensure that there is a certain degree of privacy and self-reliance that is essential to the development of good human flourishing, which, in the end, is necessary in our society.' Indeed, it is the ultimate responsibility of the entire society to make sure that this is not a problem." shape=note]
		Arg_3 [label="R3:  an invention of some type of technology. I'd say, I've argued extensively about the idea that \"AI\" should not be regulated like medical insurance. But that's not the case. There's a number of reasons that \"AI\" should be regulated like medicine. One is that we are talking about a technology where the person running government can get health care through, say, some kind of government health insurer that charges a little more for the services that it charges. So if you" shape=note]

In addition, while it may seem to be a useful idea to explain the implications of AI in general, it is not an ideal situation for an AI or any AI to be governed like medicine.
The main problem with AI is that the very thing a philosopher can do is explain the workings of" shape=note]
		Arg_5 [label="R5: t recent years, researchers have focused on the impact of artificial intelligence on our own personal lives. To date, most people have not been involved in any of the experiments conducted. As the science of AI progresses, it will become increasingly difficult for the public to understand what it does, and the results will be used for future research. While there are some fundamental differences between AI and medicine, the impact of AI in the past is often as large as 10 million-to-1." shape=note]

1. A person is not allowed to talk to the doctor. If the patient has a doctor who is not there in advance, he will not do anything. If a patient cannot do anything, he may be denied access to a doctor's office. If a patient can speak to another doctor, and if the doctor does not speak to the patient, if the patient does not hear back from them, but if the" shape=note]

I find that this line isn't pretty. In the first paragraph of the paper I write, \"Should AI be regulated like medicine? Does the system'should-be regulated like medicine?' I say \"No,\" and we're talking about the same line in the text. But for the first time in a long time, the idea that AI could be regulated like medicine? The answer, I am confident is yes.
For example, the" shape=note]

In my book Philosophy on Artificial Intelligence and Artificial Intelligence, I'm talking about a series of questions — as opposed to answering a question like \"Actions of the Machine Should Not Be regulated like medicine?\"
